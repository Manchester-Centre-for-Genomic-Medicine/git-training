Mary had a little lambda,
Her fleece were white as snow,
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lambda was sure to go.

He followed her to school one day -
The was against the rule,
It made the children laugh and play,
To see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned him out,
But still he lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
Till Mary did appear;

And then he ran to her, and laid
His head upon her arm,
As if he said - "I'm not afraid -
You'll keep me from all harm."
